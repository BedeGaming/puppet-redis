# Example sentinel.conf

# Required version: 3.2.0 and above.
# Protected mode is a layer of security protection, in order to avoid that
# Redis instances left open on the internet are accessed and exploited.
#
# When protected mode is on and if:
#
# 1) The server is not binding explicitly to a set of addresses using the
#    "bind" directive.
# 2) No password is configured.
#
# The server only accepts connections from clients connecting from the
# IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and from Unix domain
# sockets.
#
# By default protected mode is enabled. You should disable it only if
# you are sure you want clients from other hosts to connect to Redis
# even if no authentication is configured, nor a specific set of interfaces
# are explicitly listed using the "bind" directive.
# protected-mode yes
<%- if @protected_mode -%>
protected-mode <%= @protected_mode %>
<%- end -%>

# port <sentinel-port>
# The port that this sentinel instance will run on
<%- if @port -%>
port <%= @port %>
<%- end -%>

# Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force
# Redis to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard
# output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null
<%- if @logfile -%>
        logfile <%= @logfile_path %>/<%= @logfile %>
<%- end -%>
# sentinel announce-ip <ip>
# sentinel announce-port <port>
#
# The above two configuration directives are useful in environments where,
# because of NAT, Sentinel is reachable from outside via a non-local address.
#
# When announce-ip is provided, the Sentinel will claim the specified IP address
# in HELLO messages used to gossip its presence, instead of auto-detecting the
# local address as it usually does.
#
# Similarly when announce-port is provided and is valid and non-zero, Sentinel
# will announce the specified TCP port.
#
# The two options don't need to be used together, if only announce-ip is
# provided, the Sentinel will announce the specified IP and the server port
# as specified by the "port" option. If only announce-port is provided, the
# Sentinel will announce the auto-detected local IP and the specified port.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel announce-ip 1.2.3.4
<%- if @accounce_ip -%>
sentinel announce-ip <%= @announce_ip %>
<%- end -%>
<%- if @announce_port -%>
sentinel announce-port <%= @announce_port %>
<%- end -%>

# dir <working-directory>
# Every long running process should have a well-defined working directory.
# For Redis Sentinel to chdir to /tmp at startup is the simplest thing
# for the process to don't interferer with administrative tasks such as
# unmounting filesystems.
<%- if @working_dir -%>
dir <%= @working_dir %>
<%- end -%>
